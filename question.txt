We have a product catalog containing several product <div> elements.
Each product <div> has data attributes data-id and data-price, storing the product's ID and price, respectively.
There's a button in each product <div> to add the product to the card When a button is clicked,
 the addToCart function is called with the product ID as an argument.
Inside the function, we select the product using the querySelector method based on its data ID.
 then retrieve the product name and price from the selected product element using DOM manipulation and
 data attribute access.
Finally, display an alert message confirming the addition of the product to the cart along with its name and price.
